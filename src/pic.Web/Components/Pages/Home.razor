Platform Integrity Checker allows to assess deployment integrity:
<ul>
    <li>Surface health checks for registered components.</li>
    <li>Ensure routing is correctly configured by exposing a fully qualified domain name through the API Gateway service.</li>
    <li>Ensure authentication is correctly configured by exercising the IAM service.</li>
    <li>Ensure observability is correctly configured, exporting both frontend and backend telemetry to o11y service.</li>
</ul>
